          I enjoy programming and work on numerous software projects in my spare time. My main languages are TypeScript/JavaScript (ES6, React), Python, C# and Java, but I am also experienced in C/C++, PHP, MATLAB, SQL and others. Much of my programming knowledge is self-taught.

          I have always been a power user of computers. As a daily Linux user, I have made use of various command-line tools to configure a system and perform specific tasks. I enjoy completing various computing projects to improve my daily computing life&mdash;for example, setting up my own Ubuntu cloud storage server using a low-budget PC.
